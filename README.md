# Simulation testing

## How it works

See the following series of posts:

1. [Introduction to simulation
   testing](https://github.com/pragma-org/simulation-testing/blob/main/blog/dist/00-introduction.md);
2. [Using Maelstrom to test distributed
   systems](https://github.com/pragma-org/simulation-testing/blob/main/blog/dist/02-maelstrom-testing-echo-example.md);
3. [Sketching how to simulation test distributed
   systems](https://github.com/pragma-org/simulation-testing/blob/main/blog/dist/03-simulation-testing-echo-example.md);
4. Work in progress: [The main test loop of simulation
   testing](https://github.com/pragma-org/simulation-testing/blob/main/blog/dist/04-simulation-testing-main-loop.md).

## Running

See [`RUNNING.md`](RUNNING.md) for details on how to run the tests.
